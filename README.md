 &emsp; McMaster University Tuition fee Calculator (WeChat Mini-Program) 麦克马斯特大学学费计算器（微信小程序） 

# Introduction
This is a Wechat Mini-program that I developed in my second year. This application is developed for students at McMaster University to estimate their tuition fees. It would be also useful for High school students who are looking forward to studying at McMaster. This application so far can only run on the WeChat platform. You need a WeChat account to access it.



# How to Use it?
Select your level, status (Local or International students), and program. Then type the total credits you are planning to take this year/semester, and tap "Calculate" to see your tuition fee. Please be aware that the result will not include "supplementary" and "Other charges", such as the MSU fee and UHIP. The result will only include the "Tuition fee".

在小程序内正确选择自己的年级，身份，与专业，并填写自己准备在下一个学期或者学年修的学分总数，点击”计算“按钮得出学费金额。注意该小程序仅计算"Tuition"的费用，计算结果并不包含"supplementary"的费用。
